anyInventory Inventory System
=============================
Thank you for downloading anyInventory, a flexible inventory system
that can be used to track anything.  Because anyInventory
is designed in a way that allows the user to decide what type of 
information to keep track of, it is powerful enough to inventory items
from the food in your refrigerator to the stock of a department store.

Installation
============
To install anyInventory, upload the included files to your Web server 
and then run the included install.php script from the Web browser of 
your choice.  (We heartily recommend Mozilla: http://www.mozilla.org/.)
You should also make sure that all files and directories are readable
and executable by the Web server, as well as making sure that the item_files/ 
subdirectory is writable, readable, and executable by the Web server.  
(The install script will alert you if it is not writable.)

Upgrading
=========
To upgrade to anyInventory 1.9.1, simply overwrite the files from 
your current version, and then run the included upgrade.php script from 
the Web browser of your choice.

Using anyInventory
==================
The best place to start is with the documentation, found in the
docs subdirectory and linked from the main menu of anyInventory.  If all
of your questions are not answered there, you can view the project page
at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/anyinventory/.
